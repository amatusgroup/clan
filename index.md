## What is clan.?
clan. is a collaborative incentive program in which peers invest a small part of their incomes, as well as support and time in one another, thereby providing a mutually beneficial arrangement for both parties involved. Simply said, the success of your peer (through increased projects or pay) results in an increase in your investment. We are currently in the testing phase of clan. and are recruiting freelance tech professionals to join the study.



## Why are we doing this?
We at amatus. dream of a world in which collaboration is more common than competition, in which the success of our peers does not come at the expense of our own. We are passionate about designing systems that incentivise benevolent behavior, while creating tangible benefits for all parties involved. This is where the inspiration from clan. comes from. 



## What does testing require of participants?
The study will run for six months, during which we will collect data (baseline, and at the end of each month).
You don’t need to come into the office for these data collection intervals - they will be done through an online questionnaire.
You are free to drop out of the study at any point.
Ideally, you will select yourself a peer with which you want to be partnered with. If this is not possible, we will partner you with an appropriate peer based on your income, your desired support, and the support you are able to provide.
The contract negotiation will take place at amatus. HQ with our lawyer and team experts present. 
We invite you to work from our office one day per week to encourage collaboration. 
Shares are paid out at the end of each month, allowing participants to reassess if they want to continue their investment, or simply pull out their initial investment, and neither lose nor gain money. 


## Money.
You and your partner’s invested shares will simply be held in your respective bank accounts
This could be a separate savings account, or in your regular account
Can I choose how much of my income I want to invest? Of course. It can be as low or as high as you like. 
We allow each user to place an individualized income cap. For example, let’s say you earn a total of 2,500eur. p./month. You decide that your first 1,500eur. p/month is protected. This means that however much income you choose to share (let’s say 5%) will be calculated on anything above your first 1,500eur. In this case, your shared income would be 5% of (2,500eur. - 1,500eur.) = 50eur. 


## Are there any risks involved?
The short answer is - not really. 

Your partner may not be matching your expectations in terms of the time and support they offer you. In this case, you can pull out your investment after the first month, and either drop out of the study or ask to be paired with someone new. 
You can anyways drop out of the study at any point, with no losses. 
The only way to ‘lose’ money, is if your salary increases (we assume due to the help of your partner). In this case, you haven’t really lost anything at all, since your increased hourly rate or overall income will outweigh any losses in shares. Refer to Case ? for a more detailed and visual explanation of this.


## Legal matters.
The negotiation and creation of the contract will take place at amatus. HQ with a lawyer.
Is the contract legally binding? Yes. This also discourages anyone from not fulfilling their promises, and protects each of you in case one of you breaches any clauses. 

## Sold? We couldn’t be happier to hear it. Start your journey as a test user by filling out this questionnaire. 

Not yet? No problem. If you have 10 minutes to spare, please still consider filling out our baseline questionnaire - you do not have to be a study participant for your feedback to be valuable.
